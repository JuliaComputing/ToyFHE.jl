# Cryptography background

This chapter of the manual provides an overview of the various cryptographic
schemes implemented by this package. It is recommended that all users go through
this entire chapter. Even those familiar with the cryptographic schemes in
question, will find this chapter of value as a gentle usage introduction for
the underyling mathematical primitives, as well as hopefully a straightforward
statement of the actual cryptographic protocol and notational conventions used
in this package (since they sometimes differ between different papers in the
literature.)
