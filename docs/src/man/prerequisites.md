# Mathematical prerequisites

** This page needs to be written. The below is an outline **

This manual page is to be written. The intent here is to give a quick mathematical
overview of all the required mathematical concepts needed to understand the rest
of the manual. However, it is not intended as a complete reference and should
contain links to more in-depth material where applicable. Where possible this
guide should make concrete references to how theses concepts are represented
in code in this package.

## Modular Arithmetic
Provided by either the GaloisFields.jl package or Nemo.jl

## Chinese remainder theorem

## The Number Theoretic Transform - Fourier Transforms over finite fields

## Correspondence between NTT and the roots of a cyclotomic polynomial

## Hensel lifting

## Discrete Gaussians
